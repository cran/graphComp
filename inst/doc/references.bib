  abstract = {Gene expression profiles were examined in 33 adult patients with T-cell
	acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL). Nonspecific filtering criteria
	identified 313 genes differentially expressed in the leukemic cells.
	Hierarchical clustering of samples identified 2 groups that reflected
	the degree of T-cell differentiation but was not associated with
	clinical outcome. Comparison between refractory patients and those
	who responded to induction chemotherapy identified a single gene,
	interleukin 8 (IL-8), that was highly expressed in refractory T-ALL
	cells and a set of 30 genes that was highly expressed in leukemic
	cells from patients who achieved complete remission. We next identified
	19 genes that were differentially expressed in T-ALL cells from patients
	who either had a relapse or remained in continuous complete remission.
	A model based on the expression of 3 of these genes was predictive
	of duration of remission. The 3-gene model was validated on a further
	set of T-ALL samples from 18 additional patients treated on the same
	clinical protocol. This study demonstrates that gene expression profiling
	can identify a limited number of genes that are predictive of response
	to induction therapy and remission duration in adult patients with
	T-ALL.},
